So what do you do when you have record rainfall, and you are a stay at home dad with two active kids?

Take them kayaking of course... in the field near your apartment.  The rain overwhelmed the drainage system in our apartment complex, so the field became a shallow pond.  I just threw on my drysuit, put the kids in their snowsuits, and away we went.  The "pond" was only about shin-deep, which was great because I could follow them around in case they needed help.  We played around for about half an hour, letting them both have several turns, before everyone was cold and it was time to go in.  Enjoy :-)
