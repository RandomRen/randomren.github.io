I have been making my own foam soap for years.  Now that we are in the midst of a pandemic, everyone should be washing their hands regularly, but with cleaning supplies being limited, I thought it time make a short video showing how to take a little bit of dish soap, and turn it into a lot of hand soap.  One big bottle of dish soap like I show in the video is enough to last my family at least six months of regular hand washing.  There are certainly other people who do this, but we should all be sharing information freely in this important time in our history, so pass it around and be safe!
